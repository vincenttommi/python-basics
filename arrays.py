#python does not have built in  support for arrays but has lists instead
#array is a special value which can hold more than one value at a time
#accessing elements in array

# cars = ["BMW","MerceBenz","Volvo","pequot"]

# x = cars[3]
# print(x)

# #modifying value of an array

# cars = ["Benz G wagon","volvo","pequot","merceBenz"]

# cars[0] = "toyota"

#returning length of an array
#we use len()


# fruits = ["mango","banana","grapes","beans","orange","pineaple"]

# x = len(fruits)

# print(x)

#looping array element in python


# marks = [50,60,70,80,90,100]

# for x in marks:
#     print(x)

#adding array element in python
#we use append()

# cars = ["Ford","BMW","volvo"]
# cars.append("defender")

# print(cars)


# marks = [200,300,400,500]
# marks.append("700")
# print(marks)

#removing array elements we use pop()


cars = ["volvo","Defender","yatch"]
