#python does not have built in  support for arrays but has lists instead
#array is a special value which can hold more than one value at a time
#accessing elements in array

# cars = ["BMW","MerceBenz","Volvo","pequot"]

# x = cars[3]
# print(x)

# #modifying value of an array

# cars = ["Benz G wagon","volvo","pequot","merceBenz"]

# cars[0] = "toyota"

#returning length of an array
#we use len()


# fruits = ["mango","banana","grapes","beans","orange","pineaple"]

# x = len(fruits)

# print(x)

#looping array element in python


# marks = [50,60,70,80,90,100]

# for x in marks:
#     print(x)

#adding array element in python
#we use append()

# cars = ["Ford","BMW","volvo"]
# cars.append("defender")

# print(cars)


# marks = [200,300,400,500]
# marks.append("700")
# print(marks)

#removing array elements we use pop()
#remove()


# cars = ["volvo","Defender","yatch"]
# cars.pop(0)
# print(cars)

cars  = ["volvo","Toyota","Benz","Defender"]

cars.remove("volvo")
print(cars)

#arrays methods
# append() adds an element at the end of the list
# clear() removes all the elements from the list
#copy() copy an element in a list
# count() returns the numbers of elements in a list
# sort() sorts list
# reverse() reverses a list
# pop() removes elements at list arrays
# insert() inserts an element at the specified position
#extend() ends elements in a list
