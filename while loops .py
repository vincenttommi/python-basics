#types of loops in python
#while loops and for loops


# i = 10
# while i <  20:
#     i +=1
#     print(i)
    
    
#using break statement in while loop

# i = 1
# while i < 50:
#   print(i)
#   if (i == 300):
#     break
#   i += 1  
     
     
 
#continue statement in python 
#with continue statement we can  stop the current iteration and continue with the next

# i = 0
# while i < 6:
#  i += 1
#  if  i == 3:
#     continue
# print(i)


#else statement in while loop we can run a block of code when condition is not true

i = 1
while i < 50:
    print(i)
    i +=1

    print("i is no longer less than 6")
